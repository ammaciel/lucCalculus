abstract: In this package, we present a formal spatiotemporal interval logic mechanism
  extended from Allenâ€™s interval temporal logic to the spatial context. The method
  contributes with a tool to help scientists and policy makers to reason about land
  use change. We use an interval-based approach to reason about land use changes trajectories
  resulting in a formalism that allows users to express queries about the land use.
  This `lucCalculus` is a open source R package for reasoning about land use change
  trajectories.

# Introduction
Brazil, more than any other country in the world faces the challenge of balancing agricultural production and environmental protection [@Gil:2015]. Historically, forest conversion has begun with small-scale exploration, as subsistence agriculture, followed by consolidation within large-scale cattle ranching operations or abandonment to secondary forest [@Morton:2006]. But, in the last decade, the expansion of large-scale mechanised agriculture at the forest frontier has introduced as a potential new pathway for loss of forest [@Morton:2006]. This has generated a debate over the impact of pasture and cropland expansion to deforestation and, consequently, on the economy [@Arvor:2013]. Thus, we contributed to the scientific debate on the subject, as we propose methods for improving the extraction of information about land use change.
