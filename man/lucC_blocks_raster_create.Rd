\title{Create blocks from RasterBrick in accordance with number of cells}
\usage{
lucC_blocks_raster_create (raster_obj = NULL, number_blocks_xy = 6,
path_save_RasterBlocks = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster_obj}{Raster. A raster stack with classified images}

\item{number_blocks_xy}{Numeric. A number of peaces to split raster, consider 2 peaces the raster will be cropped into 4 blocks. Default is 6}

\item{path_save_RasterBlocks}{Character. Name a path folder to SAVE RasterBlocks from GeoTIFF images. If  doesn't exist, a new directory is created}
}
\value{
List with all the pieces in case you want to keep them in the memory.

\description{
Provide a data.frame with spatially aggregates the original raster it turns each aggregated cell into a polygon then the extent of each polygon is used to crop the original raster. \url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29784829/r-raster-package-split-image-into-multiples}
